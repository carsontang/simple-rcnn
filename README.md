# Simple R-CNN: A Pedagogical Implementation of R-CNN Object Detection

R-CNN (Regions with CNN Features) is an object detection method that combines region proposals with convolutional neural networks (CNN). The method was first introduced by Girshick et al in 2013 in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.2524.pdf).

[The paper's authors' implementation of R-CNN is in Matlab](https://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn). This implementation is a pedagogical one. It's not optimized for speed.

As of February 17, 2018, the implementation is still not done.
